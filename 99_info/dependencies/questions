  SHADERS might be more optimized to run through objects multplie times, instead of making unique combinations of shaders? Or there should be general Shading groups?? 

GPU switching 
  renderer_render_frame(): glBindVertexArray(curr_scene[ob].parent_mesh->vao); //!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IS IT MORE Compuetionally EXPENSIVE to switch between VertexArrays?
