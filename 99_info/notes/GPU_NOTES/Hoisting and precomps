1. How you know if the GPU hoists a uniform multiply

When you write:

uniform mat4 projection;
uniform mat4 view;
uniform mat4 model;

gl_Position = projection * view * model * vec4(aPos, 1.0);


projection and view are uniforms, i.e., constants for the draw call.

Modern GPU drivers (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel) will often analyze the shader and precompute projection * view once per draw call, then multiply it by model per vertex.

But: this is not guaranteed by the OpenGL spec. The compiler might or might not hoist it depending on:

Driver version and vendor

Shader complexity

Instruction scheduling

Other optimizations

The only way to know for sure is to:

Compile the shader with the driver and capture the GPU assembly using tools:

NVIDIA: nvprof, Nsight, nvdisasm

AMD: Radeon GPU Profiler

Intel: Intel Graphics Performance Analyzers

Look for a single multiply per vertex vs two multiplies per vertex.

Most practical engines assume the driver does the optimization, but for critical paths, engineers verify with profiling.
