4. Practical constraints

SIMD vectorization works best for batches of similar-magnitude values, because the quadrant/sign logic is simpler.

For huge angles spread across different quadrants, scalar might actually be easier or just as fast.

Most libraries (Intel SVML, MKL, ARM math) implement vectorized cosine for arrays, but single-value cos just calls the scalar kernel.
